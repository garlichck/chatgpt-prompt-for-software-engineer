📘 awesome-prompts-for-software-engineers
High-quality, production-ready ChatGPT prompts for real software engineering tasks.

Java • Spring Boot • SQL • Postgres • React • DevOps • CI/CD • System Design • Debugging • Architecture

⭐ Why This Repository Exists

Most “ChatGPT prompt collections” online are:

too generic

too shallow

not useful for real engineers

focused on fun or hobby use

This repository is different.
It is designed for real-world software engineering work — helping developers write better code, debug faster, design better systems, and increase productivity.

If you’re a Software Engineer, Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, DevOps Engineer, or Tech Lead, this is built specifically for you.
